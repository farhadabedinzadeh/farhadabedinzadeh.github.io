[Potential Biomarker for Early Detection of ADHD Using Phase-Based Brain Connectivity and Graph Theory](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13246-023-01310-y)

**Farhad Abedinzadeh Torghabeh**, Seyyed Abed Hosseini*, Yeganeh Modaresnia.

- This research investigates an efficient strategy for early detection and intervention of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms, which can significantly impact a child‚Äôs daily life. This study employed two distinct brain functional connectivity measurements to assess our approach across various local graph features. Six common classifiers are employed to distinguish between children with ADHD and healthy control. Based on the phase-based analysis, the study proposes two biomarkers that differentiate children with ADHD from healthy control, with a remarkable accuracy of 99.174%. Our findings suggest that subgraph centrality of phase-lag index brain connectivity within the beta and delta frequency bands could be a promising biomarker for ADHD diagnosis. Additionally, we identify node betweenness centrality of inter-site phase clustering connectivity within the delta and theta bands as another potential biomarker that warrants further exploration. These biomarkers were validated using a t-statistical test and yielded a p-value of under 0.05, which approved their significant difference in these two groups. Suggested biomarkers have the potential to improve the accuracy of ADHD diagnosis and could help identify effective intervention strategies for children with the condition.

[Hybrid Deep Transfer Learning Based Early Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder Using Scalogram Representation of Electroencephalography Signals](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11517-023-02959-z)

**Farhad Abedinzadeh Torghabeh**, Yeganeh Modaresnia, Mohammad Hossein Moattar*.

- Early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) plays an important role in the rehabilitation of the patient. This goal necessitates higher-level pattern representation and a strong modeling approach. The proposed approach applies scalogram images of electroencephalography signals for the first purpose and a two-level deep learning architecture for better classification. Scalogram images embed both the temporal and spectral information of the signal. On the other hand, the hybrid deep learning hierarchy of convolutional neural network followed by long short-term memory models both spatial and temporal information of the scalogram image. The approach is evaluated on a dataset of 34 ASD samples and 11 normal cases in without-voice and with-voice conditions. To validate the early diagnosis hypothesis, signals from children older than 5 years are used as the training set, and signals from younger subjects are used as the validation set. The proposed method achieves excellent performance of 99.50% and 98.43% for automatically detecting ASD with and without voice, respectively. This classification performance is higher than most recent reported approaches, and the results show the effectiveness of the approach in early diagnosis of ASD and demonstrate the auditory impact on the diagnosis of autism.
